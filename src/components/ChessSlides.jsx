                <h3>SETTING UP THE BOARD</h3>
                <p>The board is already set up for you. <span>White always moves first</span></p>

                <h3>RANKS AND FILES</h3>
                <p>Going from left to right the vertical rows on the board, called files... When the board is set up the square a1 will be on the bottom left.</p>

                <h3>HOW THEY MOVE</h3>
                <p>Pieces are <span>one-touch move:</span>
                    Once you move a piece and take your hand off it, you cannot change your mind <b>unless your opponent lets you</b>, which they do not need to do.
                    However, you may touch a piece to adjust it without moving it—just say "adjust" first. If you touch a piece, you must move it.
                    If you touch one of the pieces during the game, then place it back in its original position, as long as you don’t take your hand off it.
                </p>

                    <h4>Pawn</h4>
                    <img src="/src/assets/images/Pawn.png " className="icons" alt="pawn"></img>
                    <p>
                        White pawns start on <span>rank 2</span>, black pawns on <span>rank 7</span>. The first time a pawn moves, it may move forward either 1 or 2 squares.
                        After that, it can only move 1 square forward. <b>Pawns capture diagonally,</b> forward left or forward right one square.
                        A pawn cannot move backward.
                        If a pawn reaches the last rank (8 for white, 1 for black).
                    </p>
                
                        <h4>Bishop</h4>
                        <img src="src/assets/images/Bishop1.png" className="icons" alt="bishop"></img>

                        <p>The bishop moves <b>diagonally </b>across any distance of unoccupied squares.
                            Each player starts with one bishop on a light square and one on a dark square.
                            Bishops remain on the same color for the entire game.</p>
                        
                            <h4>Rook</h4>

                            <p>
                                The rook moves in a <b>straight line </b>in any direction: up, down, left, or right. The rook also plays a key role in castling, which is a special move involving the king.
                            </p>
                    
                                <h4>Queen</h4>
                                <img src="src/assets/images/Queen.png" className="icons" alt="queen"></img>
                                <p>The queen is the most powerful piece. It <span>can move any number of squares</span> in any direction: straight or diagonal.
                                    The queen combines <b>the power of the rook and bishop.</b></p>
                            
                                    <h4>King</h4>

                                        The most important piece on the board is<span>the king.</span> The king can move <span>one square</span> in any direction: forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally.
                                        The capture of the king is the object of the game.</p>
